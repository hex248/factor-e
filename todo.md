# CODE:

-   find a way to keep track of all loaded sprites, and only unload at the end (at the moment, the sprites are loaded + unloaded every single time they are drawn)
-   fade between tiles on ground
-   inventory
-   tools
-   save world
-   load world from save on start
    -   # CODE (DEV MODE):
    -   ctrl + r will now reload the world rather than regenerating
    -   ctrl + shift + r will regenerate the world, but will prompt the user to confirm their action before doing so
-

# ART:

-   basic player animation
-   better grass texture
-   better dirt texture
